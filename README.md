# Mars-Lander
Lunar Lander, but on Mars! Carefully land yourself on the launchpad, while preserving fuel. Don't land too fast or at too steep an angle, and you just might survive the harsh task of touching down on mars.

## Overall Gist
I would like to emulate a lot of the gameplay from one of my favorite childhood games, Lunar Lander.
However, Mars seems to be all the rage these days, so I figured why not make it on Mars?
