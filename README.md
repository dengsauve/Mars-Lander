# Mars-Lander
Lunar Lander, but on Mars! Carefully land yourself on the launchpad, while preserving fuel. Don't land too fast or at too steep an angle, and you just might survive the harsh task of touching down on mars.

## Nightly-ish Builds
All builds are hosted here: http://138.197.236.11/games/MarsLander/

Builds are in alphabetical/numberical order. (e.g. alpha-03 is a newer build than alpha-02)

No download required, I am building direct to WebGL

## Overall Gist
I would like to emulate a lot of the gameplay from one of my favorite childhood games, Lunar Lander.
However, Mars seems to be all the rage these days, so I figured why not make it on Mars?

## Goals

## Issues
If you're playing my game, first of all, thanks for checking it out. 
If you come across a problem, create an issue and I'll review it and do my best to fix it.
