# Mars-Lander
Lunar Lander, but on Mars!

## Nightly-ish Builds
All builds are hosted here: http://138.197.236.11/games/MarsLander/

No download required, am building direct to WebGL

## Overall Gist
I would like to emulate a lot of the gameplay from one of my favorite childhood games, Lunar Lander.
However, Mars seems to be all the rage these days, so I figured why not make it on Mars?

## Goals
- [x] Retro Lander controls
- [ ] 20 Levels Total
- [ ] Fuel Boost Items
- [ ] Animate Explosion
- [ ] Pause Menu
- [ ] Smooth Transistions between levels
